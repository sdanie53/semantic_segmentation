# Semantic Segmentation

 Semantic Segmentations performed on two datasets as part of the Deep Learning using Keras and Tensorflow course:
 1. KITTI Road dataset
 2. CAMVID dataset

A UNet Architecture (link to original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) has been used for the KITTI Road Dataset.
A DeepLabV3+ architecture has been used for the CAMVID dataset.
